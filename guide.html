                  Kill zombies, of course! Our best data shows that 85% of the population are infected. What's left of the government can't handle the workload, so we're hiring hardy survivors like you to help us clean things up. We can't offer you any gear or supplies,

                  No notches on a belt here. We keep track of everything so you get paid. Your personal kill count is shown on the red "Kill Zombies" button. Just above that button you'll see your total kills (TK), which includes any kills by your organization. To the
                  right of TK is the number killed per second by your organization.

                  Every time you scavenge & sell supplies, you get a little better at it. The numbers on the blue buttons show how many supplies you move when you scavenge or sell. Where it really gets interesting is when you start hiring crews & bosses. Not only
                  do crews kill zombies for you, they scavenge for supplies. Bosses find potential buyers & sell supplies to them for you. Just below your money counter at the top of the screen, you'll see your supply counter (SUP) followed by your current
                  capacity. To increase supply capacity, you need to build caches, vehicles & bases.

                  Each Crew is made up of 5 tough surviors that are good at killing zombies, scavenging, and well, surviving. Veteran Crews are more experienced, killing twice as many zombies & collecting twice as many supplies as regular Crews. Bosses are basically total
                  apocalyptic badasses. They kill the same number as Veteran Crews, all by themselves. In addition, they are the only unit that can sell supplies for you.

                  Building is an important part of growing your organization. Caches, Vehicles & Bases all increase your supply capacity. With your crews out there scavenging non-stop, you'll want to be sure you have enough storage to hang on to your valuable supplies.
                  In addition, Vehicles & Bases increase the rate at which you can scavenge & sell supplies.
